# ChipmunkVoice

ChipmunkVoice uses [SoundTouch](https://www.surina.net/soundtouch/) C++ library to change the pitch of the recorded voice.

Pitch of the voice is increased by 6 which makes it sound like a chipmunk's voice.

The same library can be used to change the tempo & playback rate of the file.

## How to use?

1. After application launch, tap on 'Start'.
2. Speak/Sing for 10 seconds. The timer can be seen running on the screen. Your voice gets recorded during this time.
3. After the completion of 10 seconds, the recorded voice with pitch increased by 6 is played back. A lottie animation is played.
4. Enjoy singing!
